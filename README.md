<h1 align="left">Hey âœ‹, I'm IÃ±aki</h1>

Welcome to my GitHub repository!
I'm IÃ±aki, Software Engineer from **Bilbao, Spain**.

I have the ability to work with different technologies and workgroups. I have worked in web development projects with the latest technologies, and even in CLI or desktop software development. Currently, I am improving my skills in Cloud development, such as services in AWS or container configuration in Docker. Also, I am looking forward to getting into the DevOps world, to improve the quality of my projects.

In addition to my programming skills, I am skilled in performing technical analysis and assisting clients in project management. As I have previously worked on projects concerning software quality, I have the ability to create projects that respect software quality standards.
